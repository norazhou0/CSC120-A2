Asking for help is critical, especially at the beginning when I’m unfamiliar with everything. I used to get frustrated when I had no idea where to start or didn’t even understand the meaning of the assignment. Starting early is also key. It took me much longer than expected because I wanted to make sure I understood every part of it. Programming isn’t like a math problem with a single, correct answer. The learning process extends beyond just the work I eventually submitted.
